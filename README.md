# Data-Analytics-Tasks-Cycle-2

A collection of end-to-end data analytics and machine learning tasks completed as part of my “Data Analytics with Python” coursework. This repository showcases practical skills in EDA, classification, clustering, explainable AI, and actionable business insights.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains solutions and detailed analysis for the following tasks:

1. **Predict Employee Attrition**  
   - Build and interpret classification models to predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset.
   - Includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression), explainability (SHAP/LIME), and HR business recommendations.

2. **Text Summarization**  
   - Preprocess textual data for summarization.
   - Implement extractive summarization using libraries like spaCy.
   - Implement abstractive summarization using pre-trained models like BERT HuggingFace's transformers.
   - Fine-tune models to improve the quality of summaries.
   - Test the model on real-world articles and evaluate summary coherence.
