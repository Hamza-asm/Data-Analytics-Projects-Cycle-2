    "# TASK 2 Text Summarization Using CNN/Daily Mail Dataset\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization is a vital Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that automatically condenses lengthy articles, news reports, or blogs into concise and informative summaries. Effective summarization helps readers quickly grasp key points and saves time when dealing with large volumes of textual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we work with the CNN/Daily Mail dataset a widely used benchmark for news summarization. Our objective is to build a summarization system capable of generating high-quality summaries from long-form news articles. We will explore both extractive methods (which select important sentences from the source) and abstractive methods (which generate new summaries in natural language using deep learning models).\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, I will document each step of the workflow, including data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation. Our goal is to deliver a robust summarization pipeline that can be applied to real-world articles.\n",

    "\n",
    "Through this project, I developed a text summarization system using both extractive and abstractive approaches on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. Here are the main takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preparation:** Careful preprocessing ensured the dataset was clean, with relevant fields and no missing or duplicate articles.\n",
    "- **Extractive Summarization:** A simple sentence-scoring baseline using spaCy provides fast, interpretable summaries by selecting the most important sentences from each article.\n",
    "- **Abstractive Summarization:** Leveraging pre-trained transformer models like BART enables generating fluent, human-like summaries that can paraphrase and condense information beyond sentence extraction.\n",
    "- **Evaluation:** By comparing model outputs with human reference summaries and computing ROUGE metrics, I demonstrated that transformer-based models deliver concise and accurate results on news articles.\n",
    "- **Limitations and Future Work:** Further improvements could be made by fine-tuning models on the specific dataset, exploring alternative architectures (e.g., T5, Pegasus), or optimizing for summary length and informativeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Value:**  \n",
    "Automated text summarization can dramatically speed up information consumption in journalism, business, and research, allowing users to grasp essential points from large volumes of text efficiently.\n",
