# Data-Analytics-Tasks-Cycle-2

A collection of end-to-end data analytics and machine learning tasks completed as part of my “Data Analytics with Python” coursework. This repository showcases practical skills in EDA, classification, clustering, explainable AI, and actionable business insights.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains solutions and detailed analysis for the following tasks:

1. **Predict Employee Attrition**  
   - Build and interpret classification models to predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset.
   - Includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression), explainability (SHAP/LIME), and HR business recommendations.

2. **Customer Segmentation with Clustering**  
   - Apply clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical) to segment customers based on purchasing behavior and demographics.
   - Includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, visualization, and practical interpretation of clusters for business targeting.

3. **Sales Forecasting and Regression**  
   - Build regression models to forecast sales using historical sales data.
   - Steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, model implementation (Linear Regression, Decision Trees), evaluation, and forecasting visualization.

4. **Churn Prediction with Model Explainability**  
   - Predict customer churn using classification algorithms and provide explainable AI insights.
   - Workflow includes data preparation, feature selection, model training (Logistic Regression, XGBoost), and interpretation with SHAP or LIME.

Each notebook includes clear code, markdown explanations, results interpretation, and business recommendations. Datasets and relevant visuals are provided for reproducibility.
