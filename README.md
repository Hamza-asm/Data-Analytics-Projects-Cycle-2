# Data-Analytics-Tasks-Cycle-2

A collection of end-to-end data analytics and machine learning tasks completed as part of my “Data Analytics with Python” coursework. This repository showcases practical skills in EDA, classification, clustering, explainable AI, and actionable business insights.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains solutions and detailed analysis for the following tasks:

1. **Predict Employee Attrition**
   Dataset: IBM HR Analytics Dataset
- Steps:  
   - Build and interpret classification models to predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset.
   - Includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression), explainability (SHAP/LIME), and HR business recommendations.
     
Outcome: A classification model for employee attrition with explainable insights for HR retention strategies.

3. **Text Summarization**
   Dataset: CNN/Daily Mail Dataset
   
 - Steps:
    - Preprocess textual data for summarization.
    - Implement extractive summarization using libraries like spaCy.
    - Implement abstractive summarization using pre-trained models like BERT HuggingFace's transformers.
    - Fine-tune models to improve the quality of summaries.
    - Test the model on real-world articles and evaluate summary coherence.
    - 
Outcome: A summarization model capable of generating

4. **Disease Diagnosis Prediction**
   
   Dataset: PIMA Diabetes Dataset or Heart Disease Dataset

- Steps:
   - Performed EDA to explore relationships between features and outcomes.
   - Apply feature selection and scale data for better model performance.
   - Trained model such as Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluated model performance using F1 Score and AUC-ROC curves.
   - Provided insights for healthcare professionals based on model
     predictions.
     
Outcome: A medical prediction model that provides actionable insights for early disease detection and prevention.
